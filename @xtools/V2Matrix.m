V2matrix
^^^^^^^^
a static method that converts a voltage trace into a LeMasson matrix.  Usage ::

   [M, V_lim, dV_lim] = V2matrix(V, V_lim, dV_lim)

where V is a vector (a voltage time series), and ``V_lim`` and ``dV_lim`` are two-element vectors that specify the lower and upper bounds of ``V`` and ``dV``

This static method allows you to create a delay-embedding of a voltage trace, and then discretize the space and count the number of points in each bin. The resultant matrix is sometimes called a LeMasson matrix. ``M`` is the LeMasson matrix, which is always of size ``101x101``.

If you do not specify ``V_lim`` and ``dV_lim``, they will be computed automatically and returned.
