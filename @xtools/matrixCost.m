matrixCost
^^^^^^^^^^
a static method to compute the distance between two LeMasson matrices. This is a useful way to determine how similar two voltage traces are.

Usage ::

	C = matrixCost(M1,M2)

where ``M1`` and ``M2`` are two matrices returned by xolotl.V2matrix() and represent discretized probability distributions of a derivative-embedded attractor of the voltage trace.

for i = 1:size(M1,1)
